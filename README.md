# Get Locked In With Me (GLWM)

**Turn long reads into quick, personal insights ‚Äî summarize, visualize, and learn smarter.** 


GLWM is a Chrome extension that enhances your web reading and learning experience with AI-powered text summarization and persistent highlighting. 


## üß† Inspiration
Sometimes, we're faced with long and complex text for studying, research, or work, and it‚Äôs easy to lose focus or miss the key ideas. We wondered, what if reading online could feel lighter, clearer, and more interactive? And why copy and paste materials to your online notebook app when you can do the same thing on the website? Those thought inspired us to build a tool that adapts to different learning styles, whether you‚Äôre a visual learner, a student, or someone who prefers quick key-point summaries. 

## üéØ Why GLWM?

Unlike typical summarization tools, GLWM builds **your personal digital learning notebook**:

- **Permanent Persistence**: Your highlights and comments stay intact even after page refreshes. Your thoughts and notes are always there when you return.
- **Personalized AI Summaries**: Tailored summaries based on your occupation and learning goals. Content is restructured for students, developers, researchers, and more.
- **Complete Privacy**: 100% offline operation using Chrome's built-in AI. Your data never leaves your computer.
- **Visual Learning**: Automatically converts complex text into diagrams for better understanding.

We don't just summarize text‚Äîwe enhance your entire web learning experience.

## üîß How It Works

GLWM combines Chrome's built-in AI with a sophisticated text positioning system:

1. **Text Selection Detection**: Floating toolbar appears when user selects text
2. **XPath-based Position Storage**: Calculates exact DOM path as XPath with character-level offsets
3. **Local Storage Saving**: Stores highlight info (position, color, comment, text) per URL in Chrome's local storage
4. **Restoration on Page Load**: Converts saved XPath back to DOM ranges and recreates highlights when page loads
5. **AI Processing**: When summarization is requested, Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI analyzes and summarizes text 100% offline

### Technical Features

- **XPath Precision**: Stores exact DOM path of text nodes, ensuring accurate position restoration when page structure remains unchanged
- **Character-level Offset**: Stores exact character position within text nodes
- **URL-based Isolation**: Manages highlights independently for each webpage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### AI Summarization Not Working

1. Verify Chrome version is 128.0 or higher
2. Check `chrome://flags` settings are configured correctly:
   - `#optimization-guide-on-device-model`: Enabled BypassPerfRequirement
   - `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`: Enabled
   - `#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano`: Enabled
3. Completely restart Chrome
4. AI APIs may not be supported in some regions or devices
5. Check Chrome Developer Console (F12) for error messages

### Highlights Disappearing

1. Page DOM structure may have changed significantly (dynamic websites)
2. Content re-rendered by JavaScript
3. Chrome local storage may be full (check in settings)
4. Page URL changed (including query parameters)

### Highlight Position Misalignment

1. Page dynamically changes content
2. Ads or popups being added/removed
3. Solution: Best used on static content (blogs, documents, etc.)

### Extension Not Loading

1. Verify Developer mode is enabled
2. Confirm correct folder selected (folder containing manifest.json)
3. Restart Chrome
4. Click "Reload" button on extension page
